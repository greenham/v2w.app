# volum.io

## Overview

_volum.io_ is a volume-to-weight converter for the kitchen.

It uses [known densities](http://blog.khymos.org/wp-content/2014/01/volume-weight-conversion-v2.xlsm) of specific ingredients to calculate the weight of a given volume of that ingredient.

Other sites/apps don't take this data into account and simply give you a static conversion.

## Why Weigh?

1. **Accuracy.** See this video: [https://youtu.be/0uevI4-j-6A](https://youtu.be/0uevI4-j-6A)
2. **Speed & Efficiency.** See this video: [https://youtu.be/YEt0I7I3MDM](https://youtu.be/YEt0I7I3MDM)

From [ChefSteps.com](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/what-you-ll-need-scale):

> Just as a good thermometer eliminates a lot of the uncertainty and guesswork from cooking, the ease of quickly weighing ingredients avoids a lot of fumbling around with inaccurate measuring spoons and cups, and increases the consistency of your cooking.
